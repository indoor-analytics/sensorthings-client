/**
 * An Observation results in a value being assigned to a phenomenon. The phenomenon is a property of a feature, 
 * the latter being the FeatureOfInterest of the Observation [OGC and ISO 19156:2011]. 
 * 
 * In the context of the Internet of Things, many Observationsâ€™ FeatureOfInterest can be the Location of the Thing. 
 * For example, the FeatureOfInterest of a wifi-connect thermostat can be the Location of the thermostat (i.e., the 
 * living room where the thermostat is located in). In the case of remote sensing, the FeatureOfInterest can be the 
 * geographical area or volume that is being sensed.
